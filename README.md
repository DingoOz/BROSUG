# Brisbane ROS User Group (BROSUG)
Welcome to the Brisbane ROS User Group

This is the online presence for the Brisbane (Australia) Robot Operating System User Group.

## Overview

The Brisbane ROS User Group (BROSUG) is open to anyone interested in the use of ROS (www.ros.org) for robotics applications. 

The group focuses on the use of ROS (Robot Operating System) to real world robots and robotic applications and the simulations to test and deploy them. ROS is open source software used to solve real world problems.

## Goals
The goals of BROSUG include:
* connecting Brisbane ROS users
* promoting the adoption and use of ROS by creating a welcoming environment to discuss and demonstrate the use of ROS
* expose the Brisbane ROS community to ROS updates and new software

Meetings are held roughly every two months. There are no fees to attend.

## What is ROS?
"ROS (Robot Operating System) is an open source software development kit for robotics applications. ROS offers a standard software platform to developers across industries that will carry them from research and prototyping all the way through to deployment and production." (source: https://www.ros.org/blog/why-ros/ )

ROS is 100% open source and has been used accross industry for an increasing number of robot platforms.
